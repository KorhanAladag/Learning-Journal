                        <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, 
                            I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews
                            of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

                    <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
                    <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, 
                        then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
                    <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about
                        my journey with the world.</p>
                    <h3>How I got started</h3>
                    <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. 
                        After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
                        summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
                    <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>

                            We obviously love libraries here at The Best Colleges because education is our main focus. We adore all 
                            libraries, whether they are college libraries, public libraries, or private libraries. For those of you who 
                            aren't "of a certain age," a library is a quiet building filled with books and reference materials dating back
                            to Ye Olde Pre-Internet Times.
